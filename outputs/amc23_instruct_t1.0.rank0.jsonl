The number of games played between right-handed and left-handed players is \\( R \\cdot L = 2L \\cdot L = 2L^2 \\).

Let \\( x \\) be the number of left-handed players. Then the number of right-handed players is \\( 2x \\). Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   x + 2x = n \\implies 3x = n \\implies x = \\frac{n}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Hence, the number of right-handed players is:\n\n   \\[\n   2x = \\frac{2n}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. ** games won by Left-handed and Right-handed Players:**\n\n   Let \\( W_r \\) be the total number of games won by right-handed players and \\( W_l \\) be the total number of games won by left-handed players. We know that:\n\n   \\[\n   W_l = 1.4 \\times W_r\n   \\]\n\n   Each game results in one win, so the total number of wins (which equals the total number of games played) is:\n\n   \\[\n   W_r + W_l = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation:**\n\n   Substitute \\( W_l = 1.4 \\times W_r \\) into the total wins equation:\n\n   \\[\n   W_r + 1.4 W_r = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\implies 2.4 W_r = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( W_r \\):\n\n   \\[\n   W_r = \\frac{n(n-1)}{4.8}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check for Integer Solutions:**\n\n   For \\( W_r \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{4.8} \\) must be an integer. This implies that \\( n(n-1) \\) must be divisible by 4.8. Since 4.8 is equivalent to \\( \\frac{24}{5} \\), \\( n(n-1) \\) must be divisible by 24 (since 4.8 is not an integer, we need \\( n(n-1) \\) to be divisible by the next integer, which is 24).\n\n6. **Find the Smallest \\( n \\) Satisfying the Divisibility Condition:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n(n-1) \\) is divisible by 24. Let's test values of \\( n \\):\n\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 \\times 0 = 0 \\) (divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 7 \\): \\( 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 8 \\): \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\) (not divisible by 24)\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\): \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\) (divisible by 24)\n\n   Therefore, the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 9 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The total number of games played in the tournament is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36\n   \\]\n\n   \\(\\boxed{36}\\)"}

To understand this pattern, let's look at the units digits of the sums of the previous row's units digits:\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 1 + 1 = 2\n- Row 3: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\n- Row 4: 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12 (units digit is 2)\n- Row 5: 1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27 (units digit is 7)\n\nWe can see that the units digit of the sum of the units digits in each row is the same as the units digit of the sum of the units digits of the previous row. This suggests that the units digits of the sums form a repeating cycle. Let's list the units digits of the sums for the first few rows:\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: 5\n- Row 4: 2\n- Row 5: 7\n- Row 6: 0 (1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27, units digit is 7)\n- Row 7: 7 (1 + 9 + 15 + 9 + 1 = 45, units digit is 5)\n- Row 8: 2 (1 + 11 + 19 + 11 + 1 = 53, units digit is 3)\n- Row 9: 5 (1 + 13 + 25 + 13 + 1 = 57, units digit is 7)\n- Row 10: 2 (1 + 15 + 35 + 15 + 1 = 67, units digit is 7)\n- Row 11: 7 (1 + 17 + 45 + 17 + 1 = 81, units digit is 1)\n- Row 12: 8 (1 + 19 + 55 + 19 + 1 = 95, units digit is 5)\n- Row 13: 5 (1 + 21 + 65 + 21 + 1 = 113, units digit is 3)\n- Row 14: 8 (1 + 23 + 75 + 23 + 1 = 123, units digit is 3)\n- Row 15: 3 (1 + 25 + 85 + 25 + 1 = 137, units digit is 7)\n- Row 16: 0 (1 + 27 + 95 + 27 + 1 = 151, units digit is 1)\n- Row 17: 1 (1 + 29 + 105 + 29 + 1 = 165, units digit is 5)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the units digits of the sums repeat every 6 rows. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is the same as the units digit of the sum of the units digits in the 1st row, because 2023 modulo 6 is 1. The units digit of the sum of the units digits in the 1st row is 1.\n\nThus, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."}

Each number in the \\(n\\)-th row is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row. This implies that the units digit of each number in the \\(n\\)-th row is determined by the units digit of the sum of the two numbers in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row, increased by 1.\n\nWe can simplify this by focusing only on the units digits:\n- The units digit of the sum of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row is the same as the units digit of the sum of the units digits of the numbers in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row, increased by 1.\n\nLet's compute the units digits for the next few rows to identify a repeating pattern:\n- Row 6: The units digits of the sum of the numbers in Row 5 are 1, 7, 1, 7, 1.

Their sum is \\(1 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 17\\) (units digit is 7). Adding 1 gives 8.\n\nFrom the above, we see that the units digits of the sums of the numbers in the rows repeat every 3 rows: 8, 8, 8.\n\nSince the pattern repeats every 3 rows, we need to determine the position of the 2023rd row in the repeating cycle.

The sum of the interior entries of the \\((k+1)\\)-th row is the sum of all the entries of the \\(k\\)-th row plus an additional 1 for each of the \\(k-1\\) internal entries of the \\((k+1)\\)-th row (since each interior entry is the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it plus 1, and there are \\(k-1\\) such sums). Therefore, the sum of the interior entries of the \\((k+1)\\)-th row is \\(S_k + 2(k-1) = 2^k - 1 + 2(k-1) = 2^k + 2k - 3\\). Adding the two 1's at the ends, we get:\n\\[S_{k+1} = 1 + (2^k + 2k - 3) + 1 = 2^k + 2k - 1 = 2^k + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1.\\]\nThus, the formula \\(S_n = 2^n - 1\\) holds for all \\(n\\).\n\nWe need to find the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row, which is \\(S_{2023} = 2^{2023} - 1\\).

For the fourth row, the sum is \\( 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12 \\).\n\nWe can observe that each row after the first row can be described by the recurrence relation:\n\\[ S_n = 2 + S_{n-1} + (n-2) \\cdot 2 \\]\nThis is because each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row, and there are \\( n-2 \\) such interior entries in the \\( n \\)-th row. Simplifying, we get:\n\\[ S_n = 2 + S_{n-1} + 2(n-2) = S_{n-1} + 2(n-1) \\]\n\nWe can now calculate the first few sums to identify a pattern:\n\\[ S_1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ S_2 = 2 \\]\n\\[ S_3 = 5 \\]\n\\[ S_4 = 12 \\]\n\\[ S_5 = 25 \\]\n\\[ S_6 = 48 \\]\n\\[ S_7 = 85 \\]\n\\[ S_8 = 160 \\]\n\\[ S_9 = 305 \\]\n\\[ S_{10} = 612 \\]\n\nWe notice that the sum of the numbers in the \\( n \\)-th row is \\( S_n = n \\cdot 2^{n-1} \\). This can be verified by induction. For the base case, \\( S_1 = 1 \\cdot 2^{1-1} = 1 \\). Assuming \\( S_{n-1} = (n-1) \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\), we have:\n\\[ S_n = S_{n-1} + 2(n-1) = (n-1) \\cdot 2^{n-2} + 2(n-1) = (n-1)(2^{n-2} + 2) = n \\cdot 2^{n-1} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of \\( S_{2023} = 2023 \\cdot 2^{2022} \\). First, we determine the units digit of \\( 2^{2022} \\). The units digits of the powers of 2 cycle every 4: 2, 4, 8, 6. Since \\( 2022 \\mod 4 = 2 \\), the units digit of \\( 2^{2022} \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 2^2 = 4 \\). Therefore, the units digit of \\( 2023 \\cdot 2^{2022} \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\), which is 2.\n\nThus, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."}

A vertex in a regular icosahedron has 5 neighbors, so there are 5 pairs \\((Q, R)\\) with \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\).

We have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{d\\mid p^k} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{p^k}{d}\\right) = 1.\n\\]\n\nThe divisors of \\( p^k \\) are \\( 1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^k \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot f(p^k) + p \\cdot f(p^{k-1}) + p^2 \\cdot f(p^{k-2}) + \\cdots + p^{k-1} \\cdot f(p) + p^k \\cdot f(1) = 1.\n\\]\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, \\( f(p^{k-1}) = -p^{k-2} \\), \\( f(p^{k-2}) = -p^{k-3} \\), and so on, up to \\( f(p) = -1 \\), and \\( f(1) = 1 \\).

For the general case, we use the Möbius inversion formula. The Möbius inversion formula states that if \\( g(n) = \\sum_{d\\mid n} f(d) \\), then \\( f(n) = \\sum_{d\\mid n} \\mu(d) g\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) \\).

The second sum can be rewritten using the property of the divisor function and the sum of divisors:\n\\[\n\\sum_{\\substack{d \\mid n \\\\ d < n}} d \\sigma\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\sigma\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) - n \\sigma(1) = \\sigma(n) \\sigma(n) - n \\cdot 1 = \\sigma(n)^2 - n.\n\\]\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(n) + \\frac{n \\sigma(n) - n}{2} - (\\sigma(n)^2 - n) = 1 \\implies f(n) + \\frac{n \\sigma(n) - n - 2\\sigma(n)^2 + 2n}{2} = 1 \\implies f(n) + \\frac{n \\sigma(n) + n - 2\\sigma(n)^2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(n)\\), we have:\n\\[\nf(n) + \\frac{n \\sigma(n) + n - 2\\sigma(n)^2}{2} = 1 \\implies f(n) = 1 - \\sigma(n).\n\\]\nThus, by induction, \\( f(n) = 1 - \\sigma(n) \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\nFinally, we need to find \\( f(2023) \\). Since 2023 is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and 2023.

We need to consider the running totals after each roll:\n\n1. After the first roll, the running total is \\(a_1\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the result of the first roll.\n2. After the second roll, the running total is \\(a_1 + a_2\\).\n3. After the third roll, the running total is \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3\\).\n4. After the fourth roll, the running total is \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3\\).\n\nThe possible values for each roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We need to find all combinations of four numbers (each between 1 and 6) that sum to 3. The only way to achieve a sum of 3 with four positive integers is if one of the numbers is 3 and the other three are 0, which is not possible since the minimum value is 1. However, we can also consider the possibility of reaching a running total of 3 after the second roll and then rolling a 0, but since 0 is not a possible outcome, we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct constraints.\n\nThe correct approach is to use complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die four times. Since each roll is independent and there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll, the total number of outcomes is:\n\\[6^4 = 1296.\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of outcomes where the running total never equals 3. We will use a recursive approach to count these outcomes. Let \\(a_n\\) be the number of sequences of length \\(n\\) that do not have a running total of 3. We can break this down based on the last roll:\n\n- If the last roll is 1, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of 2.\n- If the last roll is 2, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of 1.\n- If the last roll is 3, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of 0 (which is not possible).\n- If the last roll is 4, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of -1 (which is not possible).\n- If the last roll is 5, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of -2 (which is not possible).\n- If the last roll is 6, the previous \\(n-1\\) rolls must not have a running total of -3 (which is not possible).\n\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n\\[a_n = 5a_{n-1}.\\]\nWe need the initial condition \\(a_1\\), which is the number of sequences of length 1 that do not have a running total of 3. There are 5 such sequences (1, 2, 4, 5, 6), so \\(a_1 = 5\\).\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can find \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), and \\(a_4\\):\n\\[a_2 = 5a_1 = 5 \\times 5 = 25,\\]\n\\[a_3 = 5a_2 = 5 \\times 25 = 125,\\]\n\\[a_4 = 5a_3 = 5 \\times 125 = 625.\\]\n\nSo, there are 625 sequences of length 4 that do not have a running total of 3.

We need to consider the possible values of the first roll and how they affect the subsequent rolls.\n\n### Base Cases:\n- For \\(n = 1\\):\n  - The possible rolls are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n  -序列中没有1或2或3的总和可以是3。\n  - Therefore, \\(a_1 = 5\\) (1, 2, 4, 5, 6).\n\n### Recursive Step:\nFor \\(n \\geq 2\\), consider the first roll:\n- If the first roll is 1, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of 2.\n- If the first roll is 2, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of 1.\n- If the first roll is 3, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of 0 (which is impossible since the minimum value is 1).\n- If the first roll is 4, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of -1 (which is impossible).\n- If the first roll is 5, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of -2 (which is impossible).\n- If the first roll is 6, the remaining sequence must not have a running total of -3 (which is impossible).\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2a_{n-1}\n\\]\n\n### Calculation:\n- For \\(n = 2\\):\n  \\[\n  a_2 = 2a_1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n  \\]\n- For \\(n = 3\\):\n  \\[\n  a_3 = 2a_2 = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n  \\]\n- For \\(n = 4\\):\n  \\[\n  a_4 = 2a_3 = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n  \\]\n\n### Probability:\nThe number of sequences where the running total equals 3 at some point is:\n\\[\na_4 - \\text{(sequences where running total equals 3 at every step)}\n\\]\n\nHowever, it's clear that sequences where the running total equals 3 at every step are impossible for 4 rolls. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Sequences where running total equals 3 at some point} = 40\n\\]\n\nThe probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{1296}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{1296} = \\frac{5}{162}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 5\\) and \\(n = 162\\), and \\(m+n = 167\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{167}\n\\]"}

What is $m+n$?", "gold": "265", "answer": "To determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls and identify those sequences where the running total reaches 3 at least once.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible sums that can be achieved after each roll. The first roll can be any number from 1 to 6. The second roll can be any number from 1 to 6, so the running total after two rolls can be any number from 2 to 12. Similarly, the running total after three rolls can be any number from 3 to 18, and after four rolls, it can be any number from 4 to 24.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the running total equals 3 at least once. The only way this can happen is if the first roll is a 3, or if the second roll is a 3 after the first roll is 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, or if the third roll is a 3 after the first two rolls sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, or if the fourth roll is a 3 after the first three rolls sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each case:\n\n1. The probability that the first roll is 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n2. The probability that the second roll is 3 after the first roll is 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is \\(\\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{36}\\).\n3. The probability that the third roll is 3 after the first two rolls sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is more complex, but we can use complementary counting to find it. The probability that the first two rolls do not sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is \\(\\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{18}\\). The probability that the third roll is 3 after the first two rolls do not sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is \\(\\frac{5}{18} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{108}\\).\n4.

The probability that the first three rolls do not sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is \\(\\frac{26}{36} = \\frac{13}{18}\\). The probability that the fourth roll is 3 after the first three rolls do not sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is \\(\\frac{13}{18} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{13}{108}\\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{5}{108} + \\frac{13}{108} = \\frac{18}{108} + \\frac{15}{108} + \\frac{5}{108} + \\frac{13}{108} = \\frac{51}{108} = \\frac{17}{36}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point is \\(\\frac{17}{36}\\).
